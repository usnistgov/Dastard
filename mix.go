// Mix performns the mix for lancero data and retards the raw data stream by

// for a poor choice in the TDM firmware design, but so it goes.
//
// fb_physical[n] refers to the feedback signal applied during tick [n]
// err_physical[n] refers to the error signal measured during tick [n]
//
// Unfortunately, the data stream pairs them up differently:
// fb_data[n] = fb_physical[n+1]
// err_data[n] = err_physical[n]
//
// At frame [n] we get data for the error measured during frame [n]
// and the feedback computed based on it, which is the feedback
// that will be _applied_ during frame [n+1].
//
// We want
// mix[n] = fb_physical[n] + errorScale * err_physical[n], so
// mix[n] = fb_data[n-1]   + errorScale * err_data[n], or
// mix[n+1] = fb_data[n]   + errorScale * err_data[n+1]
//
// Second issue: the error signal we work with is a sum of NSAMP samples from
// the ADC, but autotune's values assume that we work with the _mean_ (because it
// lets autotune communicate an NSAMP-agnostic value). So we store NOT the auto-
// tune value but the value that actually multiplies the error sum.
